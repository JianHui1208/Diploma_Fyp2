        <p>John Brown Sales Manager Acme Corp. 321 Main Street Anycity, NY 12000</p>
        <p>Dear Mr. Brown,</p>
        <p>I wish to apply for the sales position advertised on Monster.com. Terry Johnson suggested that I contact you directly, as we have worked together, and he felt that I would be a good fit with your team.</p>
        <p>For the past two years I have been working in sales for Goodman &amp; Co.. I have consistently exceeded my targets and I was recognized last quarter for outstanding service. As an avid cyclist and user of many of your products, I'm aware that
            Acme Corp. is a company with tremendous potential. I am confident that my experience, communication skills, and ability to convey product benefits effectively would enable me to excel in the sales role.</p>
        <p>I would be delighted to discuss with you how I might be an asset to the Acme Corp. sales team. Thank you for your consideration; I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
        <p>Molly Smith</p>
