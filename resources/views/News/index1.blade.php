<h1>Malaysia’s exports up by 4% in November</h1>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">PETALING JAYA: Despite the Covid-19 doom and gloom, there was good news for Malaysia as exports rose by 4.3% in November compared with the same month last year, registering a total value of RM84.4 billion, said chief statistician Mohd Uzir Mahidin.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">It was third straight month for higher exports compared with the corresponding month last year. In September, exports rose to RM88.9 billion, a 13.6% increase compared with last year. In October, it stood at RM91.1 billion, a 0.2% increase from last year and a 2.4% increase from the earlier month.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">Uzir said the external trade statistics in November shows the growth in exports was driven by re-exports, widening by 18.1% or RM15.4 billion of total exports.</p>

<p style="font-size: 22px;">However, Uzir said imports, which totalled at RM67.6 billion, continued to register a negative growth of 9%.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">“This was the ninth consecutive month of decrease since March 2020. A significant decrease in imports has resulted in a higher trade surplus of RM16.8 billion,” he said.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">With the challenging global economic conditions caused by the pandemic, he said Malaysia’s total trade in November slipped by 2% to RM152 billion from RM155.2 billion in November last year.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">The Statistics Department also reported that the expansion in exports was supported mainly by higher exports to the US (+RM1.9 billion), Singapore (+RM1.8 billion), China (+RM1.7 billion), Hong Kong (+RM1.3 billion) and the European Union (EU) (RM457.4 million).</p>
