<h1>Keep track of criminals banished to Sabah, Sarawak, activist tells cops</h1>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">KUCHING: A Sarawak activist has called for police to review cases of criminals sent to rural parts of Sabah and Sarawak under the now-repealed Restricted Residence Act 1933 and Banishment Act 1959.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">Peter John Jaban said many of those banished may have married local women and settled down but could still create problems without continued supervision by police.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">He said the policy of sending criminals to rural areas was flawed in the first place because many of them simply set up shop again and influence the rural communities, especially the youths.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">“Instead of containing the problems of gangsterism, smuggling and drugs, they helped to spread it around the country into areas where the locals were used to a much simpler way of life,” he said in a statement today.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">“Some of them who were sent here before these two acts were abolished in 2011 are still here,” he said.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">Peter’s statement comes following a fight in Beaufort, Sabah, last week, where a local man was killed. The main suspect, with seven criminal cases linked to him between 2003 and 2004, is said to be from Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
