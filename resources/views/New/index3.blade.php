<h1>Returning Malaysians will not be denied entry, says minister</h1>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">KUALA LUMPUR: The government cannot prevent Malaysians intending to return home from countries that have recorded new strains of Covid-19, says Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">He said Malaysians living in countries that had a high number of Covid-19 cases had the right to return home.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">“This is the guarantee given in the Constitution and the Immigration Act also states that the government cannot prevent our people from returning home,” he said in his daily press conference here today.</p>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">He was asked to comment on the proposal for the government to restrict the entry of travellers – including Malaysians – from countries that had recorded new strains of Covid-19, such as the UK, South Africa and Hong Kong.</p>
